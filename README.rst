expat on marmalade
==================

This module can be used to build the expat library into marmalade
applications.

The source is downloaded and compiled unmodified from expat-1.95.8.tar.gz
available at www.libexpat.org or through /sourceforge.net/projects/expat/

The included example (elements.mkb) will parse a file in data/stdin.txt and put
the results in a trace file.
